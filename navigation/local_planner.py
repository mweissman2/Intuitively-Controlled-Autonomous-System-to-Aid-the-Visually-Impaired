# steps

# 1) store data from robot and environmental obstacles
    # reduce robot to a point, inflate obstacles by same area as robot
# 2) subtract robot and obstacle velocity vectors to determine relative velocity collision
# 3) create robot frame collision cone through tangent lines
# 4) rotate collision cone by adding each velocity in collision cone with obstacle velocity

# 5) use APF to quickly plan around obstacle

# for testing, we can just use webots omnipresent knowledge of obstacle positions
